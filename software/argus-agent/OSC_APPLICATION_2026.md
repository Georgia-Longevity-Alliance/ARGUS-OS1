# ARGUS-OS1 — OSC Application (2026-10-02, V3.6)

> Application to **Open Source Collective** — Open-source maintenance & development grant.
> Requested: **$17,000** · Duration: **6 months**. Prepared from verified project state.

## Project name
ARGUS-OS1 — local-first AI agent core (crate `argus-pre`)

## One-line pitch
A single-binary, local-first AI agent that runs the whole loop and your data on
your machine — no cloud, no API fees, full privacy — with real tools, memory,
skills, tasks, MCP, and a reproducible eval.

## Category / Ask
- Open-source software maintenance & development grant
- Requested: **$17,000** over **6 months**

## What we are building
Local-first AI agent in one Rust binary (MIT):
- Agent loop **Decide→Run→Compress→Repeat** with a stable prompt prefix
  (KV-cache friendly), loop guard, query rewriter, sliding-window reflection.
- **File-based memory**: profile facts, typed notes, LLM-distilled lessons &
  procedures, link graph, hybrid vector recall (local n-gram + optional Ollama
  embeddings), usefulness voting, eviction, Obsidian round-trip + auto-sync.
- **Real tools**: files, shell (sandboxed), web (SSRF-guarded incl. DNS),
  real Chrome over CDP (navigate/click/type/snapshot/screenshot/flow),
  web-search providers (DDG/Brave/SearXNG).
- **Skills** (SKILL.md), **hub** (auth + catalog), GitHub taps, browser recipes.
- **Sessions, durable tasks** (cron, parallel, dashboard), **plugin hooks**
  (incl. timers), **MCP client** (JSON-RPC stdio), **multi-worker fusion**.
- **Reproducible eval** harness (multi-file) with committed benchmarks.
- Works with **Ollama / LM Studio / llama.cpp / any OpenAI-compatible or cloud**.

## Why it matters
Agent platforms increasingly hold users' sessions, prompts, files and secrets
in the cloud. ARGUS-OS1 demonstrates the counter-path: a capable agent that
keeps everything local, works offline with open-weight models, costs nothing
per inference, and is fully inspectable (plain JSON). Relevant for researchers,
clinics and anyone handling sensitive data.

## State of the art (verified)
- **Version**: V3.6 (V1.0 → V3.6, 27 commits, active development)
- **Tools**: 20+ (memory, file, shell, web ×3 providers, browser CDP ×7,
  skills, MCP)
- **Memory**: profile (keyword-gated), typed notes, lessons+procedures
  (LLM-distilled), consolidation, reflection, rewriter, hybrid vector recall,
  voting, eviction, link graph, Obsidian sync
- **Safety**: approval-gated dangerous calls, SSRF-guard + DNS resolve, shell
  sandbox, session-only modes, loop guard
- **Benchmarks** (qwen2.5:7b, consumer machine):
  smoke **100%**, GAIA multi-file **80%** (10 tasks, 12.8 s/task)
- **Quality**: 15 unit + 2 CDP integration tests; clippy `-D warnings` clean;
  CI (fmt/clippy/test/release); installer script; MIT license

## Roadmap (6 months)

| Milestone | What | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| **M1–2** | v1.0 stabilization: browser-recipe library, hub public deployment, error-path hardening | v1.0.0 binary + docs |
| **M3–4** | Telegram remote control, MCP stream framing, graph+vector hybrid recall | remote channel + better recall |
| **M5–6** | multi-session TUI, community (Discord/issues), v1.1 release, docs polish | v1.1.0 + community |

## Deliverables (end of grant)
- Stable **v1.1** binary with installer (`scripts/install.sh`).
- Reproducible **eval suite** (GAIA multi-file) with published numbers.
- Browser automation **recipe library** (9 flows: web-research, form-fill, login-flow, search-query, collect-links, extract-table, download-file, pagination, check-status), skills hub live.
- MCP integration docs, Telegram remote channel.
- CONTRIBUTING + CI + benchmark artifacts, maintained issues.

## Budget ($17,000 / 6 months)

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Maintainer time (part-time, ~0.5 FTE × 6 mo @ $2,300/mo) | $6,900 |
| Community support, code review, issue triage (0.15 FTE × 6) | $2,000 |
| Benchmark/CI hardware & infrastructure (GPU/cloud eval runs) | $2,500 |
| Documentation, tests, recipe library authoring | $1,800 |
| Tooling/licenses (CI minutes, domain, hosting of hub) | $800 |
| Reserve (unexpected infra, travel to OSS events) | $3,000 |
| **Total** | **$17,000** |

## Differentiators
- One Rust binary, no Node/cloud runtime; local-first by design.
- Honest safety: approval gates, SSRF (string+DNS), shell sandbox, session-only modes.
- Open & inspectable: plain-JSON state, Obsidian/vector export, MIT.
- Practical for sensitive-data users (MD author — longevity research data stays on-machine).
- Reproducible: self-contained eval + committed benchmarks.
